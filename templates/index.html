                                Stone disease is a worldwide common problem with an enormous socio-economic impact.1 Amongst other countries, it is most prevalent in Pakistan2,3 where stone patients represent the bulk of all urological patients.
                                In our clinic, more than 50% of all urological patients are stone cases. Up to date, it is not known how exactly stones form in the renal system and how rapidly they may grow to a clinically significant size.4 Stones may be clinically silent for a long time. However, when they grow beyond a size of spontaneous clearance through the urinary tract, they may cause infection, obstruction, permanent kidney damage, and finally loss of the kidney. Therefore, it would be most helpful to find stones in early stages of their growth, where they are not yet clinically symptomatic.

                                Urolithiasis is a common health disorder worldwide with a lifetime risk of stone formation as high as 10- 12% in males and 6-8% in females. The prevalence of the stone disease is on the rise over the past two decades with an increasing burden of disease across gender, age, and race. Existing evidence suggests that the prevalence of kidney stone disease in Pakistan is approximately 16%.
                                The prevalence of urolithiasis by age groups is as high as 31.5% in 40-49 year-olds, 29.6% in 30-39 year-olds, and 12.2% in 20-29 year-olds.

                                Renal stones and their management present as a major burden on health care resources and, when neglected, can go on to have detrimental effects on renal function. Different risk factors include poor dietary habits, inadequate water intake, and comorbidities like diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, coronary artery disease, and depression. If preventive strategies are not employed, the 5-year rate of recurrence of kidney stones is 50%. This high risk of recurrence substantiates the significance of dietary counseling in patients with kidney stones. With little or incomplete resources regarding dietary habits to curtail stone formation available to the public, it is essential that any patient who presents to a hospital should receive dietary counseling.
To the best of our knowledge, only one study has previously aimed to gauge the perception of the population regarding the influence of commonly used dietary items. The afore-mentioned study was conducted in the United States and so understandably will differ significantly owing to the difference in dietary habits in this part of the world.
The American Urological Association guidelines identify several food and beverage items that are categorized as “stone favorable” or “stone unfavorable” with regards to their role in stone formation. An understanding of patients' perceptions can not only validate the current practices but can also lead to the identification of areas requiring special attention. Ultimately, it will result in the reduction of the health care burden and will also lower the rates of stone formation and recurrence in the general population.
